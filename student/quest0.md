# The Scenario

**[🏠Home](../README.md)** - [ Quest 1 >](quest1.md)

Our journey will start from a sensitive transaction code - **SE80** - in the SAP backend. From there, your actions will be continuously audited by Microsoft Sentinel. SE80 is maintained on the Sentinel watchlist **SAP - Sensitive Transactions**. To be able to react on such suspicious activities, we will associate a **playbook** that will send an adaptive card to the SAP Security teams offering the option to immediately block the respective user on the SAP backend. The card will contain the details of the suspicious activity, the transaction, and the user details who executed it. The security administrator will then be able to take the appropriate action.
