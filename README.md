# 🕵️ Security-Insights 2 Action 🚀 - Automatic locking of users on suspicious activity in SAP systems

`Content supporting hands-on session 1 "Automatisches Sperren von Benutzern bei ungewöhnlichen Aktivitäten" @ DSAG Technology Days March 2023`

Security incidents affect every company at some point. Given the threat landscape: It is **not** a question of **if but when**. According to [Statista 2022](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1275029/length-of-downtime-after-ransomware-attack/) the average downtime duration increases year over year and circles around 22 days. That is enough for some companies to suffer considerable damage or even go out of business. **SAP systems are a prime target** for cyber attackers.

The ability to detect suspicious activity and timely react on them is key to reduce damage.

## 🔭 Introduction

In this hands-on session you will embark on a journey to design followup activities based on raised security incident from SAP S4. You will learn how to use Azure Sentinel to detect suspicious activity and how to automate the locking of users in SAP systems and Azure AD.
