# 🕵️ Security-Insights 2 Action with SOAR 🚀 - Automatic locking of users on suspicious activity in SAP systems

🚧Under construction 🚧

`Content supporting hands-on session 1 "Automatisches Sperren von Benutzern bei ungewöhnlichen Aktivitäten" @ DSAG Technology Days March 2023`

Security incidents affect every company at some point. Given the threat landscape: It is **not** a question of **if but when**. According to [Statista 2022](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1275029/length-of-downtime-after-ransomware-attack/) the average downtime duration increases year over year and circles around 22 days. That is enough for some companies to suffer considerable damage or even go out of business. **SAP systems are a prime target** for cyber attackers.

The ability to detect suspicious activity automatically and timely react on them is key to reduce damage. This practice is called `Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR)`.

## 🔭 Introduction

In this hands-on session you will embark on a journey to design followup activities based on raised security incidents from SAP S/4HANA. You will learn how to use Azure Sentinel to detect suspicious activity and how to automate the locking of users in SAP systems and Azure AD.
